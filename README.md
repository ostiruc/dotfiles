# How to Use

- Make sure this `dotfiles` folder is in the `personal` sub-folder of the home
  directory. I.e., `~/personal/dotfiles`.
- Run `git submodule init` to ensure that the submodules are brought in as
  well.
- Run `install.sh` from within the `dotfiles` folder.
- This will stow the contents of each folder in the home directory as symbolic
  links.
